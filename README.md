## Bugs :bug:

I am openly disclosing the bugs so that everyone can know the defects prior. 

- **Scoring**: I believe that there can be a better way to evaluate the scores for all the rounds. 
- **Buttons**: The buttons once selected, should get disabled (in round 1 and 3) 
- **4 Pics 1 Word**: The last round was pretty much designed the same way as _Hangman_, it was actually supposed to take an entire word, but we did it with letters for now.
